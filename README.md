The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you add new behaviors or responsibilities to individual objects dynamically at runtime, 
without altering their original class, using wrapper objects that implement the same interface as the component they wrap, offering a flexible alternative to inheritance for extending functionality. 

It promotes composition over inheritance, adheres to SOLID principles (especially Single Responsibility and Open/Closed).
